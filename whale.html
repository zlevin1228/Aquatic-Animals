      <p class="intro">Whales are large animals that live in water. Whales<br> may look like fishes, but they are mammals. They <br> breathe air and produce milk for their young.</p>
      <p class="body">Killer whales, also called orcas, hunt everything from<br> fish to walruses – seals, sea lions, penguins, squid, sea<br> turtles, sharks and even other kinds of whales are all on<br> their menu. <br><br>Depending on the season and where they are,<br> their diet varies – some eat plenty of fish and squid, others feast mostly on seals and penguins. <br><br>But wherever they are in any of the world’s oceans, average-sized killer whales may eat about 227 kilograms <br>of food a day!</p>
