      <p class="intro">Sea stars are invertebrates related to sea urchins, sea cucumbers<br> and sand dollars, which are all echinoderms. Echinoderm means<br> spiny skinâ€”a reference to their hard, calcified skin, which helps to<br> protect them from predators.</p>
      <p class="body">Sea stars have rows of tiny tube feet extending from the grooved surface<br> on their underside. These tube feet allow them to crawl along the ocean<br> floor using suction created by an internal water-driven hydraulic system.<br> These animals also have an amazing ability to regenerate arms when they<br> are severed, or even a new body in some species. All of their vital organs<br> are located in the arms, so a portion of an arm could potentially grow a whole new sea star.</p>
