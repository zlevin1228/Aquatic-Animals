      <p class="intro">Seahorses are fish. They live in water, breath through gills and have a<br> swim bladder. However they do not have caudal fins and have a long<br> snake-like tail. They also have a neck and a snout that points down.</p>
      <p class="body">There are about 54 species of seahorses worldwide, and possibly as many<br> sub-species. It is often difficult for scientists to identify seahorses because<br> individuals of the same species can vary greatly in appearance. New species<br> continue to be found.</p>
      <p class="body">Seahorses are poor swimmers. They rely on their dorsal fin beating at 30-70<br> times per second to propel it along. Pectoral fins either side of the head help with stability and steering.</p>
