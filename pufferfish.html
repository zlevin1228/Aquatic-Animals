      <p class="intro">Pufferfish can inflate into a ball shape to evade predators. Also<br> known as blowfish, these clumsy swimmers fill their elastic<br> stomachs with huge amounts of water (and sometimes air) and<br> blow themselves up to several times their normal size.</p>
      <p class="body">Korea, China and Japan consider puffer fish a culinary delicacy and<br> only specially-trained chefs know how to serve them safely. In the<br> wild, puffer fish are predators, and eat a variety of snails, shellfish,<br> crustaceans and other fish. In captivity, puffers will eat almost anything,<br> so a variety of foods should be offered to allow for a healthy mix.</p>
